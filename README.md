# AlignCell

A deep learning model designed to integrate sequencing data across platforms, omics, and species by learning the biological features across various omics platforms, enabling the discovery of key factors. AlignCell uses the Performer encoder and a triplet loss function within a Triplet network to reduce non-biological factors from multi-source omics data and accurately capture biological features, facilitating data integration.
